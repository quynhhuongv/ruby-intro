# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:
puts 5
puts 3
# Numbers

# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 5*3
puts 5.0/3.0

# Strings
puts "Hello,world!"

# Combine strings together
puts "Tacos" + " are awesome!"

# Variables
food = "tacos"
puts food 

x = 3
y = 5
puts x + y 

# Combine strings and variables
puts "#{x+y} tacos"

# String manipulation
puts "hello".length
puts "How are you today?".upcase
